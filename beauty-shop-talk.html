                    <p>The yellow curtains that conceal Salon Surayya are hard to overlook on a street covered in the gray of refugee shelters, half-constructed buildings, and stories of poverty and displacement.</p>

                    <p>Inside, a lone beauty station decorated by the soft touches of three women waits for the occasional customer to preside over it.</p>

                    <p>Maysaa is the caregiver of her five siblings, orphaned a decade ago. Muneira wonders whether her fiancee has died in the fighting in Syria. And Surayya, the salon owner, yearns for the town where her family has spent the last three decades building a life. For a hometown and memories buried now under the rubble of war and destruction.</p>

                    <p>Salon Surayya is the first beauty shop in the village of Jama in the Syria-Lebanon border region of Wadi Khaled. Surayya says business has been on the edge since she opened the salon three months before--three to four customers a week, she says. They anticipate the weddings in the swelling population of Wadi Khaled, and the arrival of brides from across the region. Because in an economy rattled by cross-border fighting, and a massive influx of refugees, this is the only time women will reach into their pockets and indulge in beautification.</p>

                    <p>“If I didn’t open this salon, I don’t know what I would have done with myself,” says Surayya.</p>

                    <p>Surayya, along with the majority of the people in Wadi Khaled, was seeking refuge from violence that has wracked their villages across the river in Syria. She was one of the first Syrians who took to the streets when the so-called Arab Spring of 2011 first reverberated into the country. The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad undertook its first violent campaign against the protesters,and Surayya and her family trekked to the physical boundary between Syria and Lebanon, waded across the Kabir River in their pajamas, and stumbled outside Assad’s formal jurisdiction.</p>

            <div class="row">

                <div class="col-md-10">


                    <p>But for the relative safety of Lebanon, they sacrificed their freedom of movement. Lacking official papers only granted to them by passing through the Syrian government’s border crossing, Surayya’s family could not, for the first year, legally cross the military checkpoint set up at the beginning of Wadi Khaled. They were trapped in an enclave granted to the undocumented refugees by the Lebanese government, frequently visited by the rocket fire of a Syrian army that considers the area a hotbed of rebel fighters, and enclosed by a border now heavily fortified by Syrian military stations and the distinct possibility of reprisals against escaped protesters like Surayya.</p>

                    <p>The last Syrian to be trapped in a border area was a fictional one. He went by the name Abdel Wudood (Wudood rhymes with the Arabic word for borders, Hudood. Abdel means ‘slave of’ an obvious play on words) and he is the brainchild of the renowned Syrian playwright, actor and director, Dureid Lahham.</p>

                    <p>Like Surayya, Abdel Wudood builds a business establishment on the border he is trapped on. Like Surayya, the business manifests a mixture of resignation to the limboed life of border-dwelling, and a willingness to carry on, to not drown in their loss but build a life over the rubble.</p>

                <div class="col-md-1"></div>
                <div class="col-md-7">

                    <p>The film Al-Hudood was considered one of the most biting social commentaries against Arab leaders among a cannon of Lahham’s films and plays. The borders here representing an absurdity that is the product of Arab government impotence.</p>

                    <p>Wandering between the two fictional states of Sharq-estan and Gharb-estan, autonomous cantons of a large fictional Arab country, Abdel Wudood loses his passport, and is denied entry by both custom officials. He is gripped by disillusionment, and the restaurant he builds from parts of the car he can no longer use mocks the border guards that frequent the place, blending one culture and language into the space while being careful not to overstep a border marked by stones and chalk.
                    </p>
                    <p>Al-Hudood is the most powerful artistic rendering of the hotly debated topic of Arab nationalism boiling the subject down to its most tangible part, the demarcation line.</p>
                    <p>Arab nationalism rhetoric has for a long time shaped the course of our history, without affecting the 1916 Sykes-Picot demarcation lines in any real way. Pan-Arabism, Greater Syrian nationalism, Lebanese, Jordanian nationalism all warred against each other, exacting thousands of lives at times. Arab leaders nearly always appealed to the ideals of unity, no matter their political orientations. Nation-state leaders professed a desire to be subsumed by a greater Arab state, but the irony was not lost on most.</p>

                    <p>At the close of Al-Hudood, Abdel Wudood manages to garner nation-wide sympathy for his predicament after a feisty young journalist publishes his story. Protests break out, and leaders of all the Arab ‘stans’ that make up the Arab nation gather at a chaotic conference in Abdel Wudood’s abode, making impassioned speeches about releasing him from the shackles of their disunity. But their words come to naught, and custom officials wedded to bureaucracy won’t let Abdel Wudood through, rendering talk about the erasure of borders one better suited to Surraya’s establishment: it was حكي صالونات, or beauty shop talk.</p>

                    <p>“I know [the Syrian district of] Homs much more than I know the rest of Lebanon. But since the fighting in Syria broke out, we cannot go there. I feel lost,” said Muneira, Surayya’s Lebanese employee.</p>

                    <p>The villages located south-west of Homs are within earshot of the Wadi Khaled region, with some of the villages split in the middle by the international border.</p>

                    <p>Until shortly after the end of Lebanon’s civil war, the people in this cluster of villages were made up of stateless Bedouins, whose status was considered "under study". Mistaking French mandate officials for Ottoman officers, the tribesmen of the region hid in the woods while Lebanon’s only official census of 1932 was carried out. Still they fared better than most of the country because of their familial connections with a stable Syria, and physical isolation from the fighting in the rest of the country.</p>

                    <p>Until the fighting broke out in Syria, Wadi Khaled thrived on a vibrant smuggling economy. Foodstuffs, and other basic supplies were brought to the nearby Lebanese district of Akkar from Syria where goods are heavily subsidized. Chinese made motorcycles and other more sophisticated goods easily accessible in a Lebanon ruled by free trade were sent into predominantly socialist Syria. Everyone profited, including custom officials, from that border. At the same time, the demarcation line made itself scarce to those who wanted to visit family that cropped up in both countries, and enjoy the benefits of urban life in the nearest city to Wadi Khaled, the Syrian city of Homs.</p>

                    <p>In 2011, people of the Homs district were some of the first to revolt against the dictatorship of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Peaceful protesters and armed elements alike were met with bullets and bombs; whole neighborhoods were reduced to rubble in the fighting and many of the residents of Homs took flight. Some fled to other parts of the country, others to Lebanon. For richer Syrians, the border regions would prove to be just a pit stop, where bribes and political connections would facilitate their movement, for others, it would be the place where they would wait the fighting out for as long as it might last.</p>

                    <p> The once porous border is studded with Syrian regime land-mines, the smuggling trade has been rendered obsolete, and the influx of refugees has forced prices up and wages down. The result is an unemployment rate of nearly 90 percent, according to Wadi Khaled’s vice municipality chief. </p>

                    <p> The border was being enforced in a way that proved disastrous to all communities involved, entrapping those who had previously crossed the borders with ease and disrupting a community that was enriched by its existence. </p>

                    <p>“When I realized that the war was not going to stop any time soon, I decided I had to go on with my life. I sold my gold, and opened the salon,” said Surayya when we first spoke to her in April 2012, roughly one year after Syria plunged into war. </p>

                    <p>She had just visited her hometown of Tal Kalakh in the Homs region before she embarked on her business venture. Her salon, where she had labored away at many a manicure and pedicure, was in tatters, the floor an explosion of color caused by broken hair dye tubes.</p>

                    <p>Between one occasional customer and the next, Surayya’s employees searched relentlessly for a silver lining “We spend most of our time trying to make her laugh, to try to have her look at the lighter side of life,” said Muneira. </p>

                    <p>A year later, KnoozRoom returns to Wadi Khaled to find the streets lined with Syrians that have followed in Surayya's footsteps, transplanting their professions from Homs to the Wadi Khaled area and setting up shop.</p>

                                <p>Walid was shot in the back during the fighting in Homs over the last month. Right before we approached his storefront, he had been lying on the floor due to pain from wounds he has not yet treated. He entered Syria illegally, across the Kabir river, and has been unable to seek treatment because he lacks the appropriate documents. </p>
                                <p> Seven days into his stay, he started to run a chicken sandwich establishment, similar to one he owned in Homs’s Baba Amru. </p>

                                <p>Abu Mohammad claims he owes the success of his pastry shop to Homs’s version of Halawet bi Riz/حلاوة برز (a popular Arab pastry), which he says “softens the hearts of those who eat it.” </p>
                                <p> His shop sits less than a kilometer away from the Chadra checkpoint, and receives scores of Lebanese and Syrians a day preparing for a communal breaking of the fast in the month of Ramadan.
                                    <p> His shop is not only busy, with some seven workers tending to the place, but it is expanding: he has just opened a branch in the Tripoli suburb of Qobbeh.</p>

                                <p>People flock the shop of Abu Rajab which he still pays a mortgage for. “It is the cleanest meat in the area, and the cheapest,” says one Wadi Khaled local. The butcher opened the place as soon as he fled to the area from Homs’s Tal Kalakh. “I have 21 mouths feed ... I had no choice but to continue my work here,” said Ahmad.</p>
                                <p>He saves on not having employees, but benefiting from the manpower of his children, and though he runs the most popular butcher shop in the area, he says he’ll head back to Tal Kalakh if and when Assad’s regime collapses. “I’ll set up a tent and wait while my house gets rebuilt.”</p>

She would tread out of the Wadi Khaled area only to purchase supplies, risking captivity by Lebanese soldiers. A year later, Surayya has married and closed her shop for good. </p>
